# GUH2020-Boss-Game-Original
 The original multiplayer version of the boss game made for Multiplayer Online Arcade for Great Uni Hack 2020.
 
 Our team created a Jackbox-style multiplayer game made up of arcade games. My role was to create a collaborative Boss based game. I used C++ and the SDL libraries to do this, as opposed to my teammates who used Python and Java. We had issues with the library we planned to use to integrate C++ into our network, so as we were running out of time, I changed the game to be a demo version that played itself to show how it would work with multiple players.
